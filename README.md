A Study of Negative Mood on Reddit During Omicron Outbreak
This repository contains R scripts and analysis for our term paper, exploring the effect of the Omicron variant on public sentiment using Reddit comments.

We collected around 850,000 Reddit comments mentioning “Omicron” and analyzed them using natural language processing techniques. By combining emotion lexicons and frequency analysis, we identified dominant negative emotions, observed temporal changes in mood, and compared these patterns with COVID-19 case trends in the U.S.

Key features:

Data collection from Reddit using RedditExtractoR

Text cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal

Sentiment and emotion classification (anger, fear, sadness, etc.)

Visualizations of negative mood trends over time

Correlation analysis between negative moods and reported COVID-19 cases
